      <h1>Global warming</h1>
      <p>
        Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities,
        primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with
        the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly
        measured as the average increase in Earth’s global surface temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit),
        a number that is currently increasing by 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. Most of the current warming trend is extremely likely
        (greater than 95 percent probability) the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over decades to millennia.

      <h1>Climate change</h1>
      <p>
        Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates.
        These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the early 20th century are primarily driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning,
        which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. These human-produced
        temperature increases are commonly referred to as global warming. Natural processes can also contribute to climate change, including internal
        variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity,
        changes in the Sun’s energy output, variations in Earth’s orbit).
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientists use observations from the ground, air and space, along with theoretical models, to monitor and study past, present and future climate change.
        Climate data records provide evidence of climate change key indicators, such as global land and ocean temperature increases; rising sea levels; ice loss
        at Earth’s poles and in mountain glaciers; frequency and severity changes in extreme weather such as hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods
        and precipitation; and cloud and vegetation cover changes, to name but a few.

      <h1>Effects of melting glaciers on sea level rise</h1>
      <p>
        Melting glaciers add to rising sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and elevates storm surge as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent
        and intense coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons. Specifically, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest contributors of global sea level rise.
        Right now, the Greenland ice sheet is disappearing four times faster than in 2003 and already contributes 20% of current sea level rise.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much and how quickly these Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt in the future will largely determine how much ocean levels rise in the future.
        If emissions continue to rise, the current rate of melting on the Greenland ice sheet is expected to double by the end of the century.
        Alarmingly, if all the ice on Greenland melted, it would raise global sea levels by 20 feet.
